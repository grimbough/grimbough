Hi, Iâ€™m @grimbough, I am a research software engineer and data management expert at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory.

I develop and maintain a variety of tools for the analysis of biological data. In particular, I support many packages and tools for the Bioconductor project and its community, and have been a member of both the Bioconductor core team and the Community Advisory Board.

I work closely with experimental scientists and other programmers to create robust, usable, and performant analysis tools. I enjoy using software to automate tasks in order to provide rapid deployment and feedback.

I am also passionate about good software practices for reproducible research. I work extensively with version control, containers, and literate programming tools like R Markdown.
